          This site was created for a Web <br>
          Design course. <br>
          Microaggressions can be a daily <br>
          occurrence for many people  <br>
          that belong to margianalized <br>
          groups. A lot of people don’t <br>
          realize what they are saying is <br>
          insensitive and hurtful. They’re <br>
          viewed as simple jokes but can all <br>
          add up to have an extremely <br>
          harmful effect. Oftentimes <br>
          pointing out the microaggressions <br>
          is seen as being too sensitive. <br>
          The intention of creating this site <br>
          was to be informative as well as <br>
          draw attention to the issue in the <br>
          first place. My hope is that <br>
          individuals will reconsider making <br>
          similar comments in the future  <br>
          after learning information about <br>
          the fallout that can occur after.
